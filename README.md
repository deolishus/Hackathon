# Hackathon
Auto Lab Hackathon Collaboration

This is what we have so far. Basically it is a slide show with the ability to use your right and left key arrows to view the pictures.
We can always change the pictures, change window size, colors, movement and other features - this is just to give everyone an idea on what 
PYGAME is and things that we can do with it.

To run the code, CD to the appropriate folder and run "python carious.py". You can exit out of the code by pressing CTRL+C.
